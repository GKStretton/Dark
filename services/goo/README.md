# goo - go orchestrator

This isn't really an orchestrator. It's a place for the following and other
related features. Hopefully doesn't become too gooey.

- [ ] Store / make available the Piece data.
- [ ] Store / make available the Events.
- [ ] Connect with the cloud system over gRPC, facilitating communication.
- Perhaps, eventually replace pygateway and have controller<>goo be proto-based.
